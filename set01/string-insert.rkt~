;; distance-to-origin: Real Real -> PosReal
;; GIVEN: A set of Co ordinates of a 2D plane.
;; RETURNS: Distance of the co ordinate from the origin i.e (0,0)
;; EXAMPLES :
;; (distance-to-origin 3 4) = 5
;; (distance-to-origin -5 0) = 5
;; DESIGN STRATEGY: Combine simpler functions

(define (distance-to-origin x y)
  (expt (+ (* x x) (* y y)) 0.5)

;; TESTS
(begin-for-test

  (check-equal? (distance-to-origin -5 0) 5 "Distance should be 5")
